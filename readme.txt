### Project Guide for WordPress 
Project Guide is a simple, but effective documentation tool for WordPress projects. 
Create documentation content easily in your admin area, similar to adding new posts or pages.
Build your individual guide structure using the integrated Project-Guide-Builder. Include an unlimited number of items into your navigation and simply arrange them by drag and drop.  
Each navigation item can be used as a chapter headline or a section with content. You may display any page, post or Project Guide topic inside a guide section.
